# TOF-landing-page
The Odin Project Landing Page!
My first website built from scratch with images and copy pulled from personal Squarespace site.

NOTES:

HTML
+ there's so many ways to do things
+ setting up containers within containers 
+ still confused about when to use sections over divs and class over id's

CSS
+ *, *::before, *::after {box-sizing: border-box} is very useful in sizing
+ set your body margin and padding for website width
+ need to work on positioning images from each other
